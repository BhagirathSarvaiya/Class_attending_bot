## A bot that can attend your online classes
This bot works if your online classes are on the google meet platform.

First of all, you will have to add your credentials inside the code at two places i.e. your mail id and password which can be seen on the 48th line of the code.

After that , you will have to create an SQLite database which will hold the classroom codes for all the classes as per the schedules. 
The database can be easily created without coding using DB browser.
[Here](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) is the link from where you can download it. 

Once this is done, you can run the code on a virtual machine and it will attend all your online classes while joining them on time and leaving on time too. 
Also, it will automatically turn your mic and camera off before joining .
